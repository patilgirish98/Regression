        "\n",
        "   - Simple Linear Regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm used\n",
        "     to model the relationship between two variables:\n",
        "   - One independent variable (X) — also called the predictor or input.\n",
        "   - One dependent variable (y) — also called the response or output.\n",
        "   - Example:\n",
        "      - Suppose you want to predict someone's salary (y) based on their years  \n",
        "        of experience (x). Simple linear regression will try to draw a line through the data points that best describes this relationship.\n",

        "\n",
        "   - Great question! For Simple Linear Regression to give reliable results,\n",
        "     several key assumptions must be met. These assumptions ensure that the linear model accurately represents the relationship between the independent and dependent variables.\n",
        "      1. Linearity\n",
        "      2. Independence of Errors\n",

        "3. What does the coefficient m represent in the equation Y=mX+c ?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - If m > 0: Y increases as X increases (positive relationship).\n",
        "   - If m < 0: Y decreases as X increases (negative relationship).\n",
        "   - If m = 0: No relationship — Y does not change with X.\n",
        "   - Example:\n",
        "      - If m = 3, then for every 1 unit increase in X, Y increases by 3 units.\n",

        "      - If the equation is Y = 2X + 5, then:\n",
        "      - When X = 0, Y = 5\n",
